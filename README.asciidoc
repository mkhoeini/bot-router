= bot-router

A unified node.js server which can accept bot updates for several bots and reroutes them to different urls.

You can deploy it with a single click to heroku.

I mostly use it for SSL termination.

== Usage

An update recieved from telegram on the url +++https://your-addr.herokuapps.com/domain[/optional/url]/port+++ will be forwarded to +++http://domain:port/[optional/url]+++ .
